Thank you for choosing AltNNAS!

As of right now, we do not have a definitive network agreement. However, we do have some rules in place:

- You must be 13+ to register. If you are within a reasonable doubt of being underage, your console, and all accounts associated will be banned.
- Do not cheat in online lobbies/matches. This is a bannable offense.
- Do not harass, slander, or bully other users on the service.
- Do not take blind stabs at the code. It's available at https://github.com/TermOfficial/altnnas.
- If you do find a security vulnerability, please disclose of it privately to me at @terminal10.
- If you are not authorized to use this developer instance of AltNNAS, please stop using it immediately.

If you agree to these terms, press I Accept.
