# altnnas
yes, this is a take on arian's "altnnas" server (nintendo network authentication server?)
# Why?
for the benefit of rverse and Aquamarine, mostly.
Nex servers will probably be placed under altNEX-S or something.

This is still a heavy work in progress so please don't use it, you don't want to mess up the accounts on your Wii U or anything.
# Who's making this?
@TermOfficial, ~~@NoNameGivenCoder,~~ @TraceEntertains, and @a1429-fan.
# Why is the main branch getting updated so slowly?
you should look at the dev branch. code is pushed more frequently there.
# Can I use this?
Yeah. Just make sure it's open source, and disclose your changes. (Basically fork the repo and make your changes there!! Then the git history will have all the changes disclosed, basically. I think. Don't take that as legal advice.)
# I see code from Pretendo.
Yes, I know. It's why our license for our code matches the same one from Pretendo's account server.

I used to detail what we took but that was time consuming and jon said the git history would do what we needed anyway...
