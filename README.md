# altnnas
yes, this is a take on arian's "altnnas" server (nintendo network account server?)
# Why?
well pretendo is very complicated to setup which is sad so i'm going to have my own take on an account server. (this explanation doesn't make any sense but LOL!) it won't have any nex servers, though. you'll have to source that from pretendo or somewhere else yourself.

please don't expect me to actually update this..

this is a very small side hobby project or whatever and i'm not going to do much with this unless if i feel like it
# Can I use this?
as soon as i add the license, sure
