# altnnas
yes, this is a take on arian's "altnnas" server (nintendo network account server?)
# Why?
for the benefit of rverse and Aquamarine, mostly.
Nex servers will probably be placed under altNEX-S or something.

This is still a heavy work in progress so please don't use it, you don't want to mess up the accounts on your Wii U or anything.
# Why is the main branch getting updated so slowly?
you should look at the dev branch. code is pushed more frequently there.
# Can I use this?
Yeah. Just make sure it's open source, and disclose your changes. (Basically fork the repo and make your changes there!! Then the git history will have all the changes disclosed, basically. I think. Don't take that as legal advice.)
# I see code from Pretendo. (not yet as of right now)
Yes, I know. It's why our license for our code matches the same one from Pretendo's account server.

We utilize some utilities that are in the https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/account repository, such as
- Verifying console certificates
- Some code to encrypt ServiceTokens
- More will be added as we use more
