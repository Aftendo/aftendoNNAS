# altnnas
yes, this is a take on arian's "altnnas" server (nintendo network account server?)
# Why?
for the benefit of rverse and Aquamarine, mostly.
Nex servers will probably be placed under altNEX-S or something.

This is still a heavy work in progress so please don't use it, you don't want to mess up the accounts on your Wii U or anything.
# Why is the main branch getting updated so slowly?
you should look at the dev branch. code is pushed more frequently there.
# Can I use this?
as soon as i add the license, sure
